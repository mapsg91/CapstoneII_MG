## Researcher Notes
'Data source and methodology: All LTSS user and expenditure calculations are based on the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) Analytic Files (TAF). For the analyses,

==institutional LTSS included nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICFs/IID), and mental health facilities.== 
- Hospitals are not included in the definition of institutional LTSS, although these are Medicaid facilities. 
- For expenditures only, ==institutional LTSS also included disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to mental health facilities==. 
==HCBS included section 1915(c) waiver programs, section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option, section 1915(j) self-directed personal assistance services option, section 1915(k) Community First Choice, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), state plan personal care services, state plan home health services, state plan rehabilitative services, state plan case management services, and state plan private duty nursing services.== 

We reported ==Money Follows the Person== demonstration services as an ==individual category== in some of our output but ==did not include them in the aggregate calculations of total HCBS or total LTSS expenditures or users==. Except for PACE expenditures and DSH payments to mental health facilities, ==LTSS expenditures included fee-for-service (FFS) expenditures, managed care plan payments to providers for managed care services, and supplemental payments==. We assigned these expenditures to a specific LTSS category based on relevant TAF claim codes, including type of service, benefit type, program type, and waiver type. For PACE expenditures, we used capitation payment records and service tracking claims; for DSH payments to mental health facilities, we used service tracking claims and supplemental payment records. Except for PACE, we identified LTSS users for each LTSS category using FFS claims and managed care encounters, based on the same set of codes used to identify claims for the expenditure calculations. For PACE user counts, we identified enrollees based on enrollment records. Except for dual-eligibility status, which is based on the majority of enrolled months, we based the characteristics of enrollees on the most recent valid values in the calendar year. LTSS user counts and expenditures stratified by race and ethnicity should be interpreted as approximations because the calculations use both self-reported and imputed probabilities of a person being classified as a given race and ethnicity. In addition, total user counts and expenditures that are calculated by summing up the values of the different race and ethnicity amounts may not be equivalent to the true totals because they are approximations; the true user and expenditure totals appear in the data tables not stratified by race and ethnicity. Details on the data source and methodology used for the output in this workbook are available in “Methodology for Identifying Medicaid Long-Term Services and Supports Expenditures and Users, 2022.”
