## Research Question
- what effects does long term care (LTSS) funding on social vulnerability at a county-level?
	- exploratory anlysis; Which US counties stand at extrema(highest/lowest levels) of equity and economic  prosperity? Do these trends have a relationship to long term care spending as a whole and/or in part?

## Hypotheis
This exploratory analys is better framed by a demographic analysis framework rather than a binary issue tree
